## Challenge

1. Extend UIView so that it has a bounceOut(duration:) method that uses animation to scale its size down to 0.0001 over a specified number of seconds.
2. Extend Int with a times() method that runs a closure as many times as the number is high. For example, 5.times { print("Hello!") } will print “Hello” five times.
3. Extend Array so that it has a mutating remove(item:) method. If the item exists more than once, it should remove only the first instance it finds. Tip: you will need to add the Comparable constraint to make this work!
